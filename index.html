    <p id="p2">Mohammed Ali Jinnah <b>born December 25, 1876?, Karachi, India [now in Pakistan]—died September 11, 1948,
            Karachi</b> Indian Muslim politician, who was the founder and first governor-general <b>1947–48</b> of
        Pakistan.Jinnah was the eldest of seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous merchant, and his wife,
        Mithibai. His family was a member of the Khoja caste, Hindus who had converted to Islam centuries earlier and
        who were followers of the Aga Khan. There is some question about Jinnah’s date of birth: although he maintained
        that it was December 25, 1876, school records from Karachi (Pakistan) give a date of October 20, 1875.After
        being taught at home, Jinnah was sent in 1887 to the Sind Madrasat al-Islam (now Sindh Madressatul Islam
        University) in Karachi. Later he attended the Christian Missionary Society High School (also in Karachi), where
        at the age of 16 he passed the matriculation examination of the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai,
        in Mumbai, India). On the advice of an English friend, his father decided to send him to England to acquire
        business experience. Jinnah, however, had made up his mind to become a barrister. In keeping with the custom of
        the time, his parents arranged for an early marriage for him before he left for England.

        In London he joined Lincoln’s Inn, one of the legal societies that prepared students for the bar. In 1895, at
        the age of 19, he was called to the bar. While in London Jinnah suffered two severe bereavements—the deaths of
        his wife and his mother. Nevertheless, he completed his formal studies and also made a study of the British
        political system, frequently visiting the House of Commons. He was greatly influenced by the liberalism of
        William E. Gladstone, who had become prime minister for the fourth time in 1892, the year of Jinnah’s arrival in
        London. Jinnah also took a keen interest in the affairs of India and in Indian students. When the Parsi leader
        Dadabhai Naoroji, a leading Indian nationalist, ran for the British Parliament, Jinnah and other Indian students
        worked day and night for him. Their efforts were crowned with success: Naoroji became the first Indian to sit in
        the House of Commons.</p>

    <p id="p2">ABDUL SATTAR EDHI was born in 1928 <b>1928 – 2016 </b> in India, in Bantva, a small village near Joona Gurh, in
        Gujarat State.

        In 1947, after partition of the former British colony into two separate independent states, India and Pakistan,
        Abdul Sattar Edhi’s family, who were Muslims, moved to Pakistan.

        In 1974 Abdul Sattar Edhi establishes the Edhi Foundation which over the years has become the largest and best
        organized social welfare system in Pakistan and in the Third World.

        The Edhi Foundation operates on the basis of local volunteers and through private donations, in a spirit of
        tolerance and solidarity that goes beyond racial and religious barriers.
        With his wife Bilquis Abdul Sattar Edhi is still working in Karachi where his organisation helps the poorest and
        the most destitute, not only in Pakistan but also in other Third World countries.

    <h1 id="IMRANKHAN"><u><i>IMRAN KHAN</i></u></h1>
    <br>
    <p id="p3">Imran Khan <b>born October 5, 1952, Lahore, Pakistan</b> is an antiestablishment politician in Pakistan who in
        2022 became the first prime minister (2018–22) to be removed by a parliamentary vote. He rose to fame as a
        cricket player who led Pakistan’s national team to a Cricket World Cup victory in 1992. He later entered
        politics as a critic of government corruption in Pakistan, although he faced corruption charges of his own in
        2022 after falling out with the politically powerful army.

        <b>Early life and cricket career</b>
        Khan was born into an affluent Pashtun family in Lahore and was educated at elite schools in Pakistan and the
        United Kingdom, including the Royal Grammar School in Worcester and Aitchison College in Lahore. There were
        several accomplished cricket players in his family, including two elder cousins, Javed Burki and Majid Khan, who
        both served as captains of the Pakistani national team. Imran Khan played cricket in Pakistan and the United
        Kingdom in his teens and continued playing while studying philosophy, politics, and economics at the University
        of Oxford. Khan played his first match for Pakistan’s national team in 1971, but he did not take a permanent
        place on the team until after his graduation from Oxford in 1976.
        Political ascent
        In the months leading up to the legislative elections scheduled for early 2013, Khan and his party drew large
        crowds at rallies and attracted the support of several veteran politicians from Pakistan’s established parties.
        Further evidence of Khan’s rising political fortunes came in the form of an opinion poll in 2012 that found him
        to be the most popular political figure in Pakistan.

        Just days before legislative elections in May 2013, Khan injured his head and back when he fell from a platform
        at a campaign rally. He appeared on television from his hospital bed hours later to make a final appeal to
        voters. The elections produced the PTI’s highest totals yet, but the party still won less than half the number
        of seats won by the Pakistan Muslim League–Nawaz (PML-N), led by Nawaz Sharif. Khan accused the PML-N of rigging
        the elections. After his calls for an investigation went unmet, he and other opposition leaders led four months
        of protests in late 2014 in order to pressure Sharif to step down.

    <h1 id="MALALA"><u><i>MALALA YOUSAFZAI</i></u></h1>
    <br>
    <p id="p4">Malala Yousafzai was <b>born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora,</b> the largest city in the Swat Valley in what is now
        the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. She is the daughter of Ziauddin and Tor Pekai Yousafzai and has two
        younger brothers.

        At a very young age, Malala developed a thirst for knowledge. For years her father, a passionate education
        advocate himself, ran a learning institution in the city, and school was a big part of Malala’s family. She
        later wrote that her father told her stories about how she would toddle into classes even before she could talk
        and acted as if she were the teacher.

        In 2007, when Malala was ten years old, the situation in the Swat Valley rapidly changed for her family and
        community. The Taliban began to control the Swat Valley and quickly became the dominant socio-political force
        throughout much of northwestern Pakistan. Girls were banned from attending school, and cultural activities like
        dancing and watching television were prohibited. Suicide attacks were widespread, and the group made its
        opposition to a proper education for girls a cornerstone of its terror campaign. By the end of 2008, the Taliban
        had destroyed some 400 schools.

        Determined to go to school and with a firm belief in her right to an education, Malala stood up to the Taliban.
        Alongside her father, Malala quickly became a critic of their tactics. “How dare the Taliban take away my basic
        right to education?” she once said on Pakistani TV.

        In early 2009, Malala started to blog anonymously on the Urdu language site of the British Broadcasting
        Corporation (BBC). She wrote about life in the Swat Valley under Taliban rule, and about her desire to go to
        school. Using the name “Gul Makai,” she described being forced to stay at home, and she questioned the motives
        of the Taliban.

        Malala was 11 years old when she wrote her first BBC diary entry. Under the blog heading “I am afraid,” she
        described her fear of a full-blown war in her beautiful Swat Valley, and her nightmares about being afraid to go
        to school because of the Taliban.

        Pakistan’s war with the Taliban was fast approaching, and on May 5, 2009, Malala became an internally displaced
        person (IDP), after having been forced to leave her home and seek safety hundreds of miles away.

        On her return, after weeks of being away from Swat, Malala once again used the media and continued her public
        campaign for her right to go to school. Her voice grew louder, and over the course of the next three years, she
        and her father became known throughout Pakistan for their determination to give Pakistani girls access to a free
        quality education. Her activism resulted in a nomination for the International Children’s Peace Prize in 2011.
        That same year, she was awarded Pakistan’s National Youth Peace Prize. But, not everyone supported and welcomed
        her campaign to bring about change in Swat. On the morning of October 9, 2012, 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai was
        shot by the Taliban.

        Seated on a bus heading home from school, Malala was talking with her friends about schoolwork. Two members of
        the Taliban stopped the bus. A young bearded Talib asked for Malala by name, and fired three shots at her. One
        of the bullets entered and exited her head and lodged in her shoulder. Malala was seriously wounded. That same
        day, she was airlifted to a Pakistani military hospital in Peshawar and four days later to an intensive care
        unit in Birmingham, England.</p>
